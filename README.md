# The project is Parts

The project is divided into two parts
1. Client (or front End)
2. Server (or Back End)
## Client (or front End)
Go to the project directory then go to "client" directory
In the in client directory, you can run:
`npm start'
and your frontend will start.
### Server (or Back End)`

Go to the project directory then go to "server" directory
In the in server directory, you can run:
nodemon app.js

Currently the frontend and backend both uses port 3000 so you can not run both at the same time. I will update this soon.
