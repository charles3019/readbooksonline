# The project in Parts

The project is divided into two parts
1. Client (or front End)
2. Server (or Back End)
## Client (or front End)
Go to the project directory then go to "client" directory
In the in client directory, you can run:
`npm start'
and your frontend will start.
### Server (or Back End)`

Go to the project directory then go to "server" directory
In the in server directory, you can run:
nodemon app.js

Currently the frontend and backend both uses port 3000 so you can not run both at the same time. I will update this soon.

## Development

3/3/2022: Created Navbar, for that I used bootstrap5.
            Created pages for signin, signup, about us and home. The pages load without refreshing (page routing) to achieve this I used react router dom.
            in the blog https://theknowledgeburrow.com/what-is-the-difference-between-navlink-and-link/
            the author said that "React router can be an overkill for certain projects where all you need is basic navigation and routing functionalities. In that context, React Router is not necessary at all."
            For a simple project like RBO, React router is an indeed overkill but I used it anyway.
